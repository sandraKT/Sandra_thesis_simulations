# Sandra_thesis_simulations
In this implementation part of our master research, we present two trading algorithms to find optimal selling strategies to fill large execution orders.  The algorithms we propose are derived using discrete stochastic optimal control. The simulations in the notebooks are performed with historical financial market data.
